 # Artificial Intelligence
+
 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[1]  Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving".[2]
 
 ## Defining Intelligence
+
 
 As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3]  For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[4] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[5]  autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.
 
 ## History of AI
+
 
 The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956.[6]† The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[7] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[8] and laboratories had been established around the world.

 ## AI Approaches
 
 Various approaches have been explored in AI research.  Symbolic AI focused on manipulating symbols, while connectionist approaches emphasized artificial neural networks.[9] Other approaches include evolutionary computation and Bayesian networks.  Machine learning, a subfield of AI, focuses on enabling computers to "learn" without being explicitly programmed.  Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze vast amounts of data.

 ## Philosophical and Ethical Implications
 
 The potential for AI to reshape society has raised numerous philosophical and ethical questions.  Concerns have been voiced about the impact of AI on employment, privacy, and even the future of humanity.[10]  The development of responsible and beneficial AI is a growing area of focus for researchers and policymakers alike.  Bias in algorithms, autonomous weapons systems, and the potential for job displacement are among the key ethical challenges currently being debated.
